This is a firefox addon that allows the user to enable [CORS][6] everywhere by altering http responses.

Note
----

This addon is now a WebExtension.


Usage
-----

The addon's functionality can be toggled with the included button and is disabled by default.
The button can be found by right-clicking a toolbar and choosing `customize`.
It is labelled `CorsE` and has 3 states:

 - red, addon is disabled, CORS rules are upheld.
 - green, addon is enabled, CORS rules are bypassed.
 - green/red, addon is enabled and using the activation whitelist,
   CORS rules are bypassed when the origin url matches a filter in the whitelist.

A basic [CORS][6] test is available in the repository at `./_test/cors-everywhere-test.html`.

Intended for developers. Use at your own risk.


Options
-------

Available in about:addons.

 - `Enabled at startup`
   Enables this addon on startup.
 - `Force value of "access-control-allow-origin"`
   Self explanatory.
 - `Activation whitelist`
   When the addon is enabled, this will check the origin url against the whitelist
   to decide if headers will be modified. Uses regular expressions.


FAQ
---

 - The addon is enabled but the requests return content as if no user was logged in the target domain.

   Try using [withCredentials][8].
